if you're playing on 4:3, go into #resolutions/4x3 and copy the folder "resource" into the 
root folder where it should prompt you to overwrite files. this fixes the loadout and
backpack screen.

don't like pink as the main accent color? go into resource/scheme/colors.res and change the RGBA
values for Deer_Primary and Deer_Primary_Dark.
