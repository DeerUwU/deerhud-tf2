if you're playing on 4:3, go into #resolutions/4x3 and copy the folder "resource" into the 
root folder where it should prompt you to overwrite files. this fixes the loadout and
backpack screen.

- COLORS -
  don't like pink as the main accent color? go into resource/scheme/colors.res and change the RGBA
  values for Deer_Primary and Deer_Primary_Dark.

- BACKGROUNDS -
  if you only want to use a specific menu background, comment out the other menu backgrounds using // 
  in deerhud-tf-main/scripts/chapterbackgrounds.txt and menubackgrounds.txt.
